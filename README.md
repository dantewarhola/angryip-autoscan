## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Step 1: Start Angry IP Scanner
- Set your IP range
- Click "Start"
- Leave the Angry IP window **open and in focus**

### Step 2: Run the Tracker

```bash
python live_scan_tracker.py
```

### The script will:
- Wait 30 seconds
- Automatically save/export scan results every 30 seconds
- Print found IPs live in the terminal
- After 100% scan, it will auto-run `sort_ports.py`

### Step 3: View Your Report
Open the generated file:

```
sorted_by_ports.csv
```

This contains:

- Open ports
- IP addresses
- Hostnames
- Port descriptions
- Common vulnerabilities
